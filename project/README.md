My project consists of an app which can be used as a gps tracker
for our college bus

PROBLEM
-------

The main problem with our college bus is that, when the college bus comes
to pickup students, we won't know whether some college buses are running or
not. Since I am studying in a govenrment College, there are only 4 buses
for 2000 students. So whether a bus comes or not counts. If college
bus do not run, wehave to take other private bus to go to college.

So having an app to get the data is of paramount importance


APP
---
The functioning of the app is,
    0. Place a gps machine in college buses
	1. Take gps info from the college bus to firebase.
	2. Plot a map consisting of the route taken of different buses.
	3. Calculate the distance and time for the college bus to reach a user.
	4. Have other necessory details.
